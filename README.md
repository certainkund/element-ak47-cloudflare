## 🌑 The Lore: Invocation of the Relic
In the mortal world it is a **demo**, yet in the arcane archives it is a **relic**.  
**Element AK-47** binds **Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Functions, and the Gemini API** into a cathedral of code where every keystroke is a ritual.

## 🔮 Prophecy: What This Relic Does
- **Serverless Sorcery** — Cloudflare Pages + Functions power the vessel.  
- **Oracle Integration** — Gemini API fuels generative prophecy.  
- **Failsafe Rituals** — Retries, mocks, and graceful fallbacks keep the forge alive.  
- **Dual Ambience** — Gothic dark-mode or classroom light-mode.  
- **Runic Animations** — Text glows and flows as if whispered by forgotten gods.
